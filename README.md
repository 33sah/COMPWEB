# BPhO Computational Challenge 2024 Submission

The 2024 computational challenge had the theme of projectile motion and the full details of all tasks can be found at the following link: [BPhO Computattional Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/bpho/computational-challenge/BPhO_CompPhys_Challenge_2024.pdf)

## Extension Task 

For our extension task we made a GUI of the main 9 tasks (in this respository labelled accordingly) using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap and ChartJS. 

Furthermore, we made a diminishing altitude model for air resistance as an extension of Task 9 which was used in tandem with a rotational planet model with Latitude, Longitude and Launch Axis inputs. This was rendered via VPython.
